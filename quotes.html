            <div class="quoteText">
                &ldquo;Anything is one of a million paths. Therefore you must always keep in mind that a path is
                only a path; if you feel you should not follow it, you must not stay with it under any conditions.
                To have such clarity you must lead a disciplined life. Only then will you know that any path is only
                a path and there is no affront, to oneself or to others, in dropping it if that is what your heart
                tells you to do. But your decision to keep on the path or to leave it must be free of fear or
                ambition. I warn you. Look at every path closely and deliberately. Try it as many times as you think
                necessary.<br /><br />This question is one that only a very old man asks. Does this path have a
                heart? All paths are the same: they lead nowhere. They are paths going through the bush, or into the
                bush. In my own life I could say I have traversed long long paths, but I am not anywhere. Does this
                path have a heart? If it does, the path is good; if it doesn't, it is of no use. Both paths lead
                nowhere; but one has a heart, the other doesn't. One makes for a joyful journey; as long as you
                follow it, you are one with it. The other will make you curse your life. One makes you strong; the
                other weakens you.<br /><br /><br />Before you embark on any path ask the question: Does this path
                have a heart? If the answer is no, you will know it, and then you must choose another path. The
                trouble is nobody asks the question; and when a man finally realizes that he has taken a path
                without a heart, the path is ready to kill him. At that point very few men can stop to deliberate,
                and leave the path. A path without a heart is never enjoyable. You have to work hard even to take
                it. On the other hand, a path with heart is easy; it does not make you work at liking it.&rdquo;
